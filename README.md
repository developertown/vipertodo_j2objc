# vipertodo_j2objc
really hacky attempt to port viper_todo from objcio/issue-13-viper

Right now there is no xcodeproject, but this should work if you have j2objc installed 
on your machine in $(HOME)/Developer/j2ojbc  and run `make test`

All of the code in src/ is android free java code. the only dependencies are to
jars provided by the j2objc project.
